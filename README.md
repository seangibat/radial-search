This is a simple GUI for the Google Maps' API. I made it because I was unsatisfied with how maps' default search behavior makes assumptions about what you want to see, and doesn't allow you to set explicit parameters.

In the future, I hope to expand it to decrease label overlap or provide search results on the right to make label overlap less bothersome.
